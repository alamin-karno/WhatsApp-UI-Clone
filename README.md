# WhatsApp Clone (UI) - Flutter

This is whatsapp clone UI made with flutter. To made this I used flutter and dart. To make WhatsApp Like Appbar I user SliverAppbar with NestedScrollView.

This project is made for learning purpose. I made this project after joining 3 days Techofic Flutter Bootcamp 2022 by [TECHOFIC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKTAlsx58rs&list=PL0yFs0YrWE-z2j-jd4IfCwaixZo9tqNOT).

## Assements Task:
UI Cloning - Design this WhatsApp home screen as close as possible from the screenshot below.

Note: Ensure you add the effect - on scrolling down through the conversations list, the AppBar should be hidden, and only TabBar will remain pinned, and on scrolling back to top it should be visible.
